# Nettle

Nettle is a web application used by friends and family to plan an organized
camping trip.  For novice campers, planning a trip is often foiled by poor
communication and lack of preparation.  Nettle solves this problem, it allows
users to sign in and create a foot print a trip they are planning.  On each
camping trip users will be able to communicate with each other effectively
through many categories available on the page. On each trip there will be
categories such as food items, toiletries, camping tools, and many others
relative to camping.  It allows user to explicitly tell their friends what they
are bringing on the trip to prevent over packing or under packing.

## Other Features

There are certainly more features to come.  On each trip you should be able to
freely add users.  Each trip will also have a collection of personal packing
lists for each particpant.  Specifically on the food category there will be a
feature where users can state how much each item costs them and at the bottom
there will be a calculation tool for amount owed by each person.  Other high
reach features will be the weather for the day of the trip, if the trip has
expired, uploadable photos, and the ability to locate nearby hikes.
